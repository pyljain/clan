# Clan

Clan is a framework to develop agent teams using flow engineering. These agent teams can be expressed declaritively in a YAML manifest. 
Just as you would with human teams, you could assemble teams and give them access to one or more tools, define the team's vision and
express conditional interaactions in the form of Starlark functions.
